## Following are the project options

>>Predicting Housing Prices: 1. Use polynomial regression to predict the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant features. Collect data on recent house sales in a specific area and train your model on this data. 

>>Predicting Stock Prices: 2. Use polynomial regression to predict stock prices based on historical price data and other relevant features such as news sentiment, trading volume, and macroeconomic indicators.

>>Predicting Energy Consumption: 3. Use polynomial regression to predict the energy consumption of a building based on its size, age, location, and other relevant factors. This project can be particularly interesting if you have access to smart meter data.

>>Predicting Crop Yields: 4. Use polynomial regression to predict crop yields based on historical weather data, soil quality, irrigation patterns, and other relevant factors. This project can be particularly useful for farmers who want to optimize their crop production. 

>>Predicting Customer Lifetime Value: 5. Use polynomial regression to predict the lifetime value of a customer based on their past purchase behavior, demographics, and other relevant factors. This project can be particularly interesting for companies that want to optimize their customer acquisition and retention strategies.
