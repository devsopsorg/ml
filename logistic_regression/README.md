### Predicting whether a bank loan will be approved or not 

>>Predicting whether a customer will default on a credit card payment

### Picking Predicting whether a bank loan will be approved or not. As the example is of finance domain and for feature engineer domain knowledge is necessary. Hence taken referece from https://github.com/ankit-kothari/Credit-Risk-Analysis. Thanks Ankit Kothari for awsome work. 

## The project is having Four parts
### 1. Feature Engineering
1. Feature engineering which includes, remvoing un-necessary non indexed columns.
2. Remove Null rows
3. Convert string columns to Categorical column by mapping values to categories
4. Remove not required indexed columns.

### 2. Converting Features and Target data to Test and Train data set

### 3. Create Model and train it.

### 4. Evaluate performance of model.

### I find from sklearn.model_selection import  cross_val_predict during this learning.
